= Introduction =

This is a summary of why we chose Google Code for our web-based project management system.


= Details =

We looked at:

*Freepository*
  * Had a good clean layout and appeared to be very solid.  
  * Nice demo functionality
  * Tiered membership.  Just the basic free version of the membership did not include all the features that we needed.

*SourceForge*
  * Not user friendly.  There was no information as to what features were available.  You either could create a new project, get involved (?), or find software.
  * Site is maintained by ads.

*OW2Consortium*
  * A consortium dedicated to the development of open source component based middleware. 
  * We simply do are not interested in doing this at least at this time.  Does not seem to be a project management tool for everyone.

*TuxFamily*
  * A non-profit organization dedicated to provided free services to developers who embrace the free software philosophy.
  * All projects are hosted for free with many available services, however your project has to be officially accepted.  It must be reviewed by a panel it looks like of at least four people.

*Launchpad*
  * Not suiting our requirements in so far as we are not interested in joining a larger community right now.  One of Launchpad's goals is to share everything.  Everyone can make contributions, give comments on code, cross platform bug fixes etc.
